        <p class="text-left"><%= image_tag("dataentry-msgenetics.jpg", :style => "max-height:200px;float:right; margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px;") %>The Multiple Sclerosis Genetic Susceptibility Project is a multi-center research study dedicated to finding the genetic factors underlying the development of MS and affecting disease progression.
          The project was established in 1989 and builds on the effort of scientists and staff with synergistic skills and demonstrated commitment to this
          effort. The principles of cooperation, dedication, and innovation have been conducive to the growth of the group and its scientific productivity.</p>

        <h2 class="text-left">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-left">The goal of the MS Genetics Group at UCSF is to fully understand the genetic causes of multiple sclerosis (MS) and to apply the fundamental knowledge that we acquire to improve our capacity to prevent, diagnose, and treat the disease.</p>

        <h2 class="text-left">Patient Participation</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">Our research depends on the support and participation of individuals diagnosed with MS and their family members, spouses, and friends. We maintain a unique repository of DNA and other
          biological materials that together, constitute a resource of great importance in promoting studies on genetic susceptibility and development of biomarkers in MS.</p>

          Dr. Oksenberg is the G.A. Zimmermann Endowed Chair in Neurology. As a native from Argentina, Dr. Oksenberg received his Ph.D. in Immunology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, and joined the UCSF faculty in 1993 following post-doctoral training at Stanford University. Since 1979 his research has focused in the areas of human
          immunogenetics and the control of the immune response. He has authored numerous publication and scholarly reviews in the field and is a leading investigator in the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium.

          Stacy started working with the MS Genetics Research Group in July of 1998, after graduating from the University of California, Santa Cruz with a bachelor degree in Neuroscience and Behavior. In addition to heading up the DNA genotyping projects, she works in quantitative PCR, and SNP/expression
          chips. More recently, Stacy is leading the application of immunological assays to assess the functional role of genetic variants associated with MS susceptibility and progression.
